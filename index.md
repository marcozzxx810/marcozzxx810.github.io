## About Me

I am an incoming Master's student at Peking University, advised by [Prof. Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [The University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://hku.hk/). I have worked as an AI Developer at [Intact Lab](https://intactlab.ca/hong-kong/) since July 2022, developing full-stack AI systems with a focus on machine learning infrastructure and cloud-based solutions.

## Research Interests

I explore how **multimodal large language models (LLMs)** and **generative AI** can revolutionize robotic perception and decision-making. My work focuses on:

- Developing foundation models that fuse vision, language, and action for embodied intelligence

- Leveraging generative techniques (e.g., diffusion models, LLM planners) to synthesize training data, simulate environments, and improve robotic adaptability

- Building scalable frameworks where multimodal LLMs enable robots to interpret open-world instructions and generalize across tasks

## Education

- **Master's in Computer Science**, Peking University (2024.9–Current)
- **Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence**, University of Hong Kong (2018.9–2022.7)

## Professional Experience

- **AI Engineer**, IntactLab (2022.7-Current)
- **Student Research Assistant**, Complex Neural Signals Decoding Lab in HKU (2021.2-2022.6)
- **Student Intern -- Machine Learning**, NVIDIA (2021.6-2022.1)
- **Software Engineer Intern**, Bowtie Life Insurance (2020.6-2020.9)

## Miscellaneous

In my free time, I enjoy competitive programming 💻, playing snooker 🎱, running 🏃, and table tennis 🏓. I also like playing guitar 🎸 to relax.
